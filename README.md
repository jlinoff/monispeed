# monispeed - monitor internet connection speed

This project captures the speed of your internet connection over
time. It contains two tools: `monispeed.sh` and `plot-speed.gp`.

It was written because I suspected (and later confirmed) that my
internet speed did not match the speed that my ISP claimed.

The `monispeed.sh` _bash_ script collects data about the internet speed
and stores it in a CSV (comma separated variable) format file.  It wraps

The generated CSV data file can then be read by the `plot-speed.gp`
_gnuplot script_ to generate a simple plot that the shows the
speed over time.

The tools require _gnu date_, a recent version of _bash_ (5.x),
a recent version of _gnuplot_ (5.x) and recent version of _python_ (3.10).

This is an example of a plot that was generated from an hours worth of
data collection.

As you an see, the plot changes color. It is red when the speed drops
below 50Mpbs otherwise it is green.

The example plot was generated by running `make week` and then
plotting a partial result later _while_ the make command was still
running: `./plot-speed.gp monispeed-2022-07-08-week.csv`

These tools can be used to monitor your interconnection to see how
fast it is. The data and plot can also be presented to your
internet service provider (ISP) to help track down service problems.

### initial setup
This is not required because the setup is checked before each target is run.

```bash
make setup
```

### get an hourly report:

```bash
make hour
```

### get a daily report:
